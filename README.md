## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run dev          # watch mode (rebuilds on save)
```

Load in Chrome:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `dist/` folder

Create a Chrome Web Store ZIP with `npm run package`. The package is written to `dist/avtonet-garaza-<version>.zip`; it contains only the production build, not tests, source maps, dependencies, or source files.

## Smart Advisor Scoring

Score **0–100** computed from weighted signals found in listing text, specs, and metadata:

| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| Low mileage (< 80k km) | +15 |
| Service history / warranty / inspection | +10 each |
| Many photos, garaged, first owner | +5–8 each |
| Red-flag keyword (accident, urgent, as-is, no test drive…) | −12 each |
| Very high mileage (> 250k km) | −20 |
| High mileage (> 150k km) | −10 |
| Unusual price sanity-check signal | −3 |

**≥ 62** → Nižje zaznano tveganje
**38–61** → Preverite podrobnosti
**< 38** → Višje zaznano tveganje

Price signals are intentionally conservative. They are not live market valuations and should be compared against current similar listings.

## Architecture Notes

- **Manifest V3** — service worker background, no persistent background page
- **React 18** + Webpack 5 bundled into three entry points: `background.js`, `content.js`, `popup.js`
- **Write-queue mutex** in `storage.js` serialises all `chrome.storage.local` writes to prevent race conditions between the monitoring cycle and manual saves
- **Shared price parser** (`utils/parsePrice.js`) used by both content script and service worker to guarantee identical number parsing
- **SPA navigation** handled by `MutationObserver` + `popstate` listener with injection-state reset on URL change
- **ErrorBoundary** wraps the entire React tree — corrupted storage data shows a recovery screen instead of a blank popup

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # webpack watch mode — reload extension after each build
npm run build        # minified production build
npm run test         # focused unit tests for parsing, scoring, storage, monitor diffs
npm run validate     # tests + high-severity audit + production build
npm run clean        # remove dist/ cross-platform
```

After rebuilding, reload the unpacked extension from `chrome://extensions`.
